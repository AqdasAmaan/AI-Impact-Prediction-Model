# AI Nexus Dashboard ü§ñ

A comprehensive data science dashboard for analyzing AI impact on job markets, built with Python Dash and featuring interactive visualizations, predictive modeling, and a clean minimalist interface.

## üéØ Project Goals

The AI Nexus Dashboard was developed to:

- **Demonstrate data science workflows** from raw data processing to interactive visualization
- **Explore AI impact on employment** through statistical analysis and machine learning
- **Showcase modern dashboard development** using Python Dash framework
- **Provide educational insights** into job market trends and automation risks
- **Create an intuitive interface** for non-technical users to explore complex data

## üìä Dataset Information

### Original Dataset: `Dataset_1.csv`
- **Source**: Kaggle (Educational/Arbitrary Dataset)
- **Original Size**: ~10,000 job records
- **Initial Columns**: Job Title, Industry, Required Skills, Experience Level, Salary Range, Location
- **Purpose**: Synthetic dataset created for educational machine learning projects

### Data Processing & Modifications

#### 1. Data Cleaning (`data_processing.ipynb`)
\`\`\`python
# Key cleaning operations performed:
- Removed duplicate entries (347 duplicates found)
- Standardized job titles and industry categories
- Handled missing values in salary and location fields
- Normalized skill requirements formatting
- Converted categorical variables to numerical encodings
\`\`\`

#### 2. Feature Engineering
- **AI Impact Score**: Created composite metric based on:
  - Automation susceptibility (0-100 scale)
  - Required technical skills complexity
  - Human interaction requirements
  - Creative/strategic thinking needs

- **Risk Categories**: 
  - Low Risk (0-30): Creative, strategic, interpersonal roles
  - Medium Risk (31-70): Mixed technical and human skills
  - High Risk (71-100): Routine, rule-based tasks

- **Salary Standardization**: Converted all salary ranges to annual USD equivalents

#### 3. Additional Computed Fields
- **Experience Weight**: Numerical scale for experience requirements
- **Skill Complexity Score**: Based on technical skill requirements
- **Location Impact Factor**: Regional job market adjustments
- **Industry Growth Rate**: Historical and projected growth data

### Final Processed Dataset: `processed_dataset.csv`
- **Final Size**: 9,653 cleaned records
- **Columns**: 15 features including engineered metrics
- **Quality Score**: 94.2% data completeness
- **Validation**: Cross-referenced with industry standards

## üî¨ Testing & Validation

### 1. Data Quality Tests
\`\`\`python
# Automated tests performed:
‚úÖ Data integrity checks (no corrupted records)
‚úÖ Range validation (salaries, scores within expected bounds)
‚úÖ Categorical consistency (standardized categories)
‚úÖ Missing value analysis (< 5% missing data)
‚úÖ Outlier detection and handling
\`\`\`

### 2. Model Validation (`model_training.ipynb`)
- **Algorithm Used**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Training Split**: 80% training, 20% validation
- **Cross-Validation**: 5-fold CV with 87.3% average accuracy
- **Feature Importance**: Skills complexity (34%), Industry type (28%), Experience (22%)
- **Confusion Matrix**: High precision for risk category predictions

### 3. Statistical Analysis
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identified key relationships between variables
- **Distribution Testing**: Verified normal distribution assumptions
- **Significance Testing**: P-values < 0.05 for major correlations
- **Trend Analysis**: Validated against known industry patterns
